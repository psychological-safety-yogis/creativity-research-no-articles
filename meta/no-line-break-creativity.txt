My hypothesis is that very divergent thinkers are the key to leaping into the future even faster. I understand that a lot of pushing the envelope innovation might well come from those on the schizophrenia spectrum, like schizotypal people. Can you help me tease out the relevant portions of each of these articles so that i can put the sections in my literature review? \\ Perchtold-Stefan et al. (2022) \\ This study examined the relationship between schizotypy and malevolent creativity, which is "creativity purposefully geared toward inflicting material, mental, or physical harm on others." It was expected that individuals high in impulsive nonconformity (antisocial schizotypy) and unusual experiences (positive schizotypy) would score higher on measures of malevolent creativity. The results supported the hypothesis that impulsive nonconformity was positively correlated with malevolent creativity, but the results for unusual experiences were mixed. \\ Del Missier et al. (2022) \\ This study examined creativity in individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorder compared to healthy controls. The results showed that the schizophrenia group performed worse on both convergent and divergent thinking tasks. The authors concluded that "both facets of creativity...are affected in patients with schizophrenia, in contrast with the long-standing myth and anecdotal narrative of a positive relation between creativity and schizophrenia." \\ Aguilera and Rodriguez-Ferreiro (2021) \\ This study examined the relationship between schizotypy and creativity. The authors hypothesized that positive schizotypy would be positively associated with creativity, while negative and disorganized schizotypy would be negatively associated with creativity. The results did not support a relationship between positive schizotypy and creativity. However, they did find that lower scores in negative schizotypy were associated with more creative products, and lower scores in disorganized schizotypy were associated with a more creative personality. \\ Rodrigue and Perkins (2012) \\ This study examined divergent thinking abilities across the schizophrenia spectrum. The authors hypothesized that individuals with schizotypal personality disorder would have higher divergent thinking scores than healthy controls and individuals with schizophrenia. The results partially supported this hypothesis, as individuals with schizophrenia had lower divergent thinking scores than the other two groups, but there was no significant difference between the schizotypal and healthy control groups. \\ Spann et al. (2022) \\ This study examined the relationship between social anhedonia (a component of negative schizotypy) and convergent thinking. The authors hypothesized that individuals with elevated social anhedonia would exhibit better performance on a convergent thinking task. The results of two studies supported this hypothesis, as the social anhedonia group had better performance than controls on the convergent thinking task. \\ Webb et al. (2017) \\ This study explored the relationship between schizotypy, convergent thinking, divergent thinking, and insight problem-solving. The authors hypothesized that positive schizotypy would be a significant predictor of insight problem-solving, but not non-insight problem-solving. They also predicted that positive schizotypy would have a positive relationship with divergent thinking. The results did not support a relationship between schizotypy and insight problem-solving, and the relationships between divergent thinking and insight problem-solving were weak. \\ Armstrong (2012) \\ This study examined the relationship between creative cognition, schizotypal symptoms, and creative achievement. The author hypothesized that accounting for complex relationships between these variables would increase the ability to predict creative performance. The results supported the idea of a multistage process in which creative cognition variables interact with each other to predict performance on a creative problem-solving task. However, there was no evidence of a creative cognitive advantage in schizotypy. \\ Additional Insights from the Email and Blog Post \\ The email thread and blog post you provided offer additional insights into the relationship between schizotypy and creativity. The email thread mentions several organizations that support neurodiversity in the workplace, highlighting the growing recognition of the value that neurodiverse individuals can bring to organizations. The blog post suggests that "often viewed as a hindrance, having a quirky or socially awkward approach to life may be the key to becoming a great artist, composer, or inventor." It also mentions research that found individuals with schizotypal personalities are more creative than both neurotypical and schizophrenic individuals. \\ Kleibeuker et al. (2012) \\ This study examined the development of creative cognition throughout adolescence using a battery of insight and divergent thinking tasks. The results showed that performance on insight tasks increased with age, while performance on divergent thinking tasks varied depending on the specific measure and age group. The authors concluded that "adolescent development is not only a time of immaturity but also of flexibility and potential for creativity." \\ Dahmen-Wassenberg et al. (2016) \\ This study examined the relationship between different facets of creativity and the "dark side" of personality (narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy). The results showed that openness to experience was the strongest predictor of both self-estimated creativity and divergent thinking performance. Self-estimated creativity was also significantly predicted by narcissism and reduced reality testing. The authors concluded that "facets of the bright side of personality (such as openness) seem to have a much stronger link to creativity than less desirable personality traits do." \\ Jones et al. (2011) \\ This study investigated the relationship between nonclinical schizotypy, handedness, and divergent and convergent creative problem-solving tasks. The results showed that individuals scoring higher on a measure of schizotypy performed better on divergent thinking tasks but worse on convergent thinking tasks. Additionally, left-handed individuals demonstrated higher degrees of schizotypy than right-handed individuals. \\ Furnham (2015) \\ This study examined the personality trait and personality disorder correlates of creative potential using a divergent thinking test. The results showed that personality disorder variables accounted for incremental variance over the Big Five personality traits and intelligence. Specifically, imaginative (schizotypal) and colorful (histrionic) scores were the best positive predictors of divergent thinking, while diligent (obsessive-compulsive) and skeptical (paranoid) scores were the most negative predictors. \\ Scientific American Blog Post (2011) \\ This blog post discusses the link between creativity and eccentricity, highlighting examples of highly creative individuals who exhibited unusual behaviors. It also mentions research that has explored the connection between creativity and psychopathology, including schizophrenia and depression. \\ ScienceBeta Blog Post (2014) \\ This blog post discusses a 2005 study that found individuals with schizotypal personalities are more creative than both neurotypical and schizophrenic individuals. The study also found that schizotypal individuals rely more heavily on the right side of their brains for creative tasks. \\ Horng et al. (2021) \\ This study explored the concept of imagination as a mental act of conceptual combination, or the joining of two or more concepts to generate a new concept. The authors developed two forms of an imagination test based on conceptual combination theory. In the test, participants were presented with 18 unrelated noun-noun pairs and asked to generate an original idea for each pair. The results showed that the originality of participants' responses on the imagination test was a reliable predictor of their creative performance in design projects. However, originality was not related to divergent thinking ability or creative personality, suggesting that imagination may be a distinct psychological construct. \\ Sosa and van Dijck (2022) \\ This study used computational agent-based simulations to examine the distinction between "Big-C" and "little-c" creativity. The authors argued that this distinction, which implies a hierarchy of creativity, is conceptually weak and cannot consistently explain the generative processes of creators. The results of their simulations showed that in a social system of creative designers, both highly skilled ("Big-C") and less skilled ("little-c") agents could generate high-quality designs. This suggests that factors other than individual skill level, such as social dynamics and chance, play a significant role in creative outcomes. \\ Aschauer et al. (2022) \\ This study focused on the development and validation of a new test, the divergent problem-solving ability in science test (DPAS), designed to assess students' potential to generate diverse solutions for scientific problems. The DPAS consists of two subtests: one focused on general scientific problems and the other on experimental problems. The results showed that the DPAS is a valid and reliable measure of divergent problem-solving ability in science and that it is suitable for use in intervention studies aimed at fostering this ability. \\ Wechsler et al. (2022) \\ This study investigated whether creativity could be combined with intelligence in a group test battery (BAICA - Intelligence and Creativity Battery). The battery included tasks related to fluid and crystallized intelligence, as well as tasks related to creative thinking (fluency, flexibility, originality, and elaboration). The results indicated that creativity could be considered a distinct factor contributing to general intelligence, suggesting the need to integrate creativity measures into intelligence assessments for a more comprehensive understanding of cognitive potential. \\ Xie et al. (2022) \\ This study examined whether creative ability could be predicted based on functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data, specifically the functional connectivity between the brain's default mode network (DMN) and frontoparietal control network (FPCN). The authors used a natural language processing method to objectively quantify creative performance on a divergent thinking task. The results showed that both static and dynamic functional connectivity between the DMN and FPCN could predict creative ability, with the dynamic model showing a stronger prediction. \\ Xu and Pang (2020) \\ This study investigated whether concept mapping, a tool for organizing and representing knowledge, could facilitate verbal divergent thinking. The authors conducted three studies, the first of which found a positive association between individuals' concept mapping ability and their performance on a verbal divergent thinking task (the alternative uses task). The second study showed that generating cross-links (connections between concepts in different segments of the concept map) was a key factor in this relationship. The third study further revealed that dissociative ability (the ability to generate semantically unrelated concepts) mediated the relationship between cross-links and verbal divergent thinking. \\ De Garrido (2022) \\ This paper proposed a conceptual design for a creative artificial intelligence (AI) system based on the neurocognitive bases of human creativity. The author identified eleven neurocognitive factors that contribute to human creativity and suggested corresponding parallels for the design of a computational AI system. The proposed system is a multi-agent system with three groups of agents: the "serious group," the "playful group," and the "control group," which correspond to the brain's Executive Control Network (ECN), Default Mode Network (DMN), and Salience Network (SN), respectively. \\ Liu et al. (2021) \\ This study examined the effects of novelty and appropriateness on psychotherapeutic insight. The authors conducted three experiments using a micro-counseling dialogue paradigm, in which participants were presented with problems and solutions varying in novelty and appropriateness. The results showed that both novelty and appropriateness facilitated insightfulness and positive emotions. Additionally, the study found that individuals with high test anxiety generated lower insightfulness compared to those with low test anxiety, particularly when the solution was inappropriate to the problem context. \\ Runco et al. (2023) \\ This study investigated how creative activity is expressed in different settings: school, home, and the natural environment ("outside"). The authors used the Creative Activities and Accomplishments Checklist (CAAC) to assess creative activity in these three settings. The results showed that creative activity varied significantly across settings, with the highest level of creative activity reported at home. This suggests that different environments may differentially allow for the expression of creative potential. \\ Puryear and Lamb (2020) \\ This study aimed to replicate and extend the findings of Plucker, Beghetto, and Dow (2004) regarding the definition of creativity in academic research. The authors surveyed articles from business, education, psychology, and creativity journals and found a small but notable increase in the reporting of explicit definitions of creativity since 2004. However, there were also significant differences in how creativity was defined across different fields, suggesting a lack of consensus on the core elements of creativity. \\ Lloyd-Cox et al. (2022) \\ This study examined how the context of an idea (i.e., its real-world relevance) and the personality of the rater can influence how novelty and usefulness are considered when evaluating creativity. Participants rated the novelty, usefulness, and creativity of ideas from two contexts: the Alternative Uses Task (AUT; a lab-based measure of creativity) and genuine suggestions for urban planning projects. The authors also assessed participants' openness, intellect, and risk-taking. The results showed that novelty was more important for evaluating creativity in the AUT, while usefulness was more important for evaluating the urban planning projects. Additionally, individuals higher in openness and intellect placed greater emphasis on novelty when evaluating AUT ideas, but greater emphasis on usefulness when evaluating the projects. \\ Martin-Brufau and Corbalan Berna (2021) \\ This study investigated the relationship between external search (searching for information in the environment) and internal search (cognitive processes involved in divergent thinking). The authors hypothesized that divergent thinking could be conceptualized as a type of internal search. They tested 859 children on various visual and semantic search tasks, as well as divergent thinking tasks. The results supported the idea that external and internal search processes share common mechanisms, suggesting that divergent thinking can be understood as a form of cognitive search. \\ Verger et al. (2022) \\ This study examined the relationship between artistic achievements, emotion dysregulation (difficulty managing emotions), and self-compassion. The authors hypothesized that artistic achievements would be associated with lower emotion dysregulation and that self-compassion would mediate this relationship. They also predicted that self-compassion would moderate the relationship, with the association between artistic achievements and emotion dysregulation being strongest for individuals with low self-compassion. The results supported all three hypotheses, suggesting that artistic creativity can have positive effects on mental health and that self-compassion plays a key role in this relationship. \\ Wang et al. (2021) \\ This study used event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate how individuals with different levels of creativity evaluate creative objects. Participants were divided into high-creativity and low-creativity groups based on their performance on a creative problem-finding task. They were then asked to evaluate the creativity of various pictorial stimuli while their brain activity was recorded. The results showed that the high-creativity group had higher accuracy rates on the evaluation task and exhibited different ERP patterns compared to the low-creativity group. These findings suggest that individuals with higher creativity may process creative information more effectively. \\ Qu and Liu (2021) \\ This study examined how leader characteristics and behaviors can influence the implementation of creative ideas in new product development (NPD) teams. The authors hypothesized that leaders with a performance-prove goal orientation (a desire to demonstrate competence and outperform others) would be more likely to facilitate the implementation of creative ideas. They also investigated the role of boundary-spanning strategies (activities that involve reaching out to others for resources and support). The results showed that leader performance-prove goal orientation and boundary-spanning strategies both positively moderated the relationship between idea generation and implementation. \\ Park et al. (2021) \\ This study investigated the relationship between creative self-efficacy (CSE; the belief in one's ability to be creative) and innovative team performance. The authors hypothesized an inverted U-shaped relationship, where moderate levels of CSE would be most beneficial for team innovation. They also examined the moderating effects of educational background diversity and agreeableness. The results supported the inverted U-shaped relationship and showed that educational diversity positively moderated the relationship between CSE and team innovation. However, agreeableness did not have a significant moderating effect. \\ Casakin and Levy (2020) \\ This study examined the relationship between design expertise, design ability, and creative ideation. The authors hypothesized that design ability would mediate the relationship between creative ideation and design expertise. They also investigated the moderating role of experience. The results supported the mediation model and showed that experience moderated the relationship between ideation and design ability, with the relationship being stronger for less experienced designers. \\ Hong et al. (2020) \\ This study investigated the cognitive processes involved in the Chinese Radical Assembly Game (CRAG), a game that assesses lexical competence by having participants combine Chinese radicals to form characters. The authors used eye-tracking and behavioral measures to examine the implicit and explicit problem-solving processes involved in the game. The results showed that individuals who could quickly scan and process different radicals had higher accuracy rates in forming characters. Additionally, the study found a positive correlation between CRAG performance and performance on the Chinese Remote Associates Test (a measure of creativity), suggesting that the CRAG may involve creative thinking. \\ Frith et al. (2021) \\ This study investigated the relationship between attention control, fluid intelligence (Gf), and divergent thinking. The authors hypothesized that attention control would be a stronger predictor of divergent thinking than Gf. They also examined the role of mind wandering (task-unrelated thought). The results showed that a general executive factor (representing the common variance among attention control, Gf, and mind-wandering measures) significantly predicted divergent thinking originality. However, mind wandering was not a significant predictor, and the residual effects of Gf were no longer significant when the general executive factor was included. These findings suggest that the relationship between Gf and divergent thinking may be largely driven by attention control. \\ Rainone et al. (2021) \\ This study examined popular-press claims about organizational creativity and innovation to investigate the research-practice gap in this area. The authors identified 17 common claims and coded a sample of popular-press articles to determine the prevalence and nature of these claims. The results showed that some claims were consistent with the research literature, while others were not. Additionally, the study found that most authors of popular-press articles were entrepreneurs or journalists, with few having a background in research. \\ The Impact of Surface and Deep Acting on Employee Creativity (Jiang et al., 2020) \\ This study examined how two emotion regulation strategies, surface acting (faking emotions) and deep acting (modifying inner feelings), relate to employee creativity. The authors proposed that these strategies would indirectly influence creativity through their impact on affective commitment (emotional attachment to the organization), with psychological safety (feeling safe to take risks and express oneself) acting as a moderator. Results from a survey of 546 employees in China showed that surface acting was negatively related to creativity, while deep acting was positively related, both through their influence on affective commitment. Additionally, psychological safety strengthened the positive relationship between affective commitment and creativity. \\ The Curvilinear Relation between Work Predictability and Creativity (Ng et al., 2020) \\ This study investigated the relationship between work predictability (the degree to which employees can anticipate work demands) and creativity. The authors hypothesized an inverted U-shaped relationship, where moderate predictability would be most beneficial for creativity. They also examined the moderating roles of supervisor and coworker support. Results from a survey of 128 employees in Belgium supported the inverted U-shaped relationship, showing that both too much and too little predictability can hinder creativity. Additionally, the negative effects of low predictability were stronger for employees with low supervisor or coworker support. \\ The Advantage of Disadvantage: Is ADHD Associated with Idea Generation at Work? (Sibley et al., 2022) \\ This study explored the relationship between Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) symptoms and idea generation at work. The authors hypothesized that ADHD symptoms would be positively associated with idea generation due to increased planning discrepancies (unexpected changes or challenges) but negatively associated due to decreased perceived meaningfulness of work. Results from a study of 258 Israeli adults showed that both hypotheses were partially supported, with ADHD symptoms indirectly influencing idea generation through both planning discrepancies and perceived meaningfulness. However, the total effect of ADHD on idea generation was not significant. \\ The Association between Imagination and Anxiety in the Times of the COVID-19 Pandemic (Gregory et al., 2022) \\ This study examined the relationship between imagination, anxiety, and loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors hypothesized that increased time spent in imagination would be associated with higher anxiety levels, particularly for individuals experiencing loneliness. Results from two studies, one with US college students and another with an international community sample, supported this hypothesis. Lonely individuals who spent more time imagining experienced the largest increases in anxiety during the pandemic compared to before. \\ The Effect of Psychological Symptoms on Divergent Thinking in Healthy Older Adults (Perna et al., 2022) \\ This study investigated the impact of psychological symptoms (depression, anxiety, and apathy) on divergent thinking (DT) abilities in healthy older adults. The authors hypothesized that these symptoms would negatively affect DT. Results from a study of 45 elderly participants showed that apathy was negatively correlated with fluency and flexibility, depression was negatively correlated with originality, and education level (a proxy for cognitive reserve) moderated the relationship between apathy and DT. \\ Does Episodic Retrieval Contribute to Creative Writing? An Exploratory Study (Madore et al., 2022) \\ This study explored whether episodic retrieval (recalling personal experiences) contributes to creative writing. The authors used an episodic specificity induction (ESI) to selectively enhance episodic retrieval and examined its effects on the generation of episodic details in creative writing. Results from two experiments provided some evidence that ESI increased the number of episodic details in participants' writing, suggesting a potential role for episodic retrieval in creative writing. \\ Does the Task Structure Impact the Fluency Confound in Divergent Thinking? An Investigation with TTCT-Figural (Dollinger et al., 2022) \\ This study examined how the structure of divergent thinking (DT) tasks can influence the fluency confound (FC), where the number of ideas generated is often mistaken for creativity. The authors focused on the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (TTCT)-Figural, which has two different task structures. Results from 477 adults showed that FC was largely avoided when the task structure restricted fluency. Additionally, confirmatory factor analyses supported a two-factor structure even without the fluency-heavy task, suggesting that the two-factor structure is not solely due to FC. \\ Effective Strategies for Creative Idea Evaluation and Feedback: The customer's always right (Litchfield et al., 2020) \\ This study identified and categorized compensatory strategies (ways to improve creative ideas) used by participants during a creative idea evaluation task. The authors also examined the impact of leader feedback on these strategies and the resulting creative solutions. Results showed that effective strategies focused on improving product value for the customer, while ineffective strategies focused on profit and marketing. Negative leader feedback reduced the use of ineffective strategies, and feedback that combined innovative and operative standards led to more original solutions. \\ Emulating Coworkers: How and When Coworker Ideation Facilitates Employee Ideation (Fang et al., 2020) \\ This study explored how the average ideation levels of coworkers within a workgroup influence a focal employee's ideation. The authors proposed that high coworker ideation levels would enhance a focal employee's creative self-efficacy, leading to increased ideation, and that this effect would be stronger when the employee had a high-quality exchange relationship with coworkers. Results from two field studies supported these hypotheses, highlighting the importance of social context and relationships in fostering employee creativity. \\ Zielińska et al. (2022) \\ This paper explores the psychometric properties of the Short Scale of Creative Self (SSCS), a widely used self-report measure of creative self-efficacy (CSE) and creative personal identity (CPI). The study used a large sample (N > 26,000) from 14 independent studies and employed item response theory (IRT) to examine the quality of the scale's items and overall measurement. The results confirmed the two-factor structure of the SSCS and its good psychometric properties. However, the study also found that the items were "easy" in the psychometric sense, meaning that most people agreed with them, which could limit the scale's ability to distinguish between individuals with high levels of creative self-concept. The authors recommend adding more difficult items to future versions of the SSCS to address this issue. \\ Beaty et al. (2022) \\ This study focuses on the Alternate Uses Task (AUT), a common measure of divergent thinking (a component of creativity). The authors aimed to identify a set of AUT items that could be reliably and validly scored using semantic distance, an automated method that quantifies the originality of ideas. They conducted two studies, the first of which involved reanalyzing data from a previous fMRI study to select 13 items that loaded onto a common latent semantic distance factor. The second study replicated these findings and showed that the semantic distance scores for these items were moderately correlated with measures of creative personality. The authors conclude by providing recommendations for using semantic distance to assess originality in divergent thinking tasks. \\ Lambert (2020) \\ This article proposes that creativity can be understood as a characteristic of complex adaptive systems (CAS). CAS are systems in which diverse, interconnected elements adapt their behavior based on interactions with each other and their environment. The author argues that the many paradoxes identified in creativity research, such as the tension between knowledge and naivete or the need for both mindfulness and mind-wandering, can be explained by the order-chaos dynamic inherent in CAS. This dynamic suggests that creative individuals and processes are constantly navigating between order and chaos, resulting in unpredictable yet patterned outcomes. The author concludes by suggesting that viewing creativity through the lens of complexity theory can lead to new insights and approaches for enhancing creativity and managing innovation. \\ Weinstein et al. (2022) \\ This study explored the factors that contribute to the perceived creativity of verbal responses in a sentence generation task. The authors developed a computational algorithm to score sentences on eight different metrics, including word infrequency, syntax uniqueness, rhyme, and phonetic similarity. They found that six of these metrics were significantly correlated with human ratings of creativity, suggesting that both novelty (e.g., unusual word combinations) and effectiveness (e.g., rhyme and phonetic similarity) play a role in how creative a sentence is perceived. The authors conclude that their findings can help to develop better methods for both human and automated assessment of creativity in verbal responses. \\ Ferreira (2021) \\ This study examined the relationship between timelessness (the experience of being fully immersed in an activity to the point of losing track of time) and creative process engagement in the workplace. The author hypothesized that timelessness would mediate the relationship between individual and work environment factors (intrinsic motivation, task autonomy, and perceived supervisor support) and creative process engagement. Results from a multilevel analysis of 200 employees across 35 companies supported this hypothesis, showing that timelessness explained the indirect effects of these factors on creative process engagement. The author concludes by discussing the practical implications of these findings for managers seeking to enhance employee creativity. \\ Acar and Runco (2014) \\ This study investigated the use of three computerized semantic networks (WordNet, Word Associations Network, and IdeaFisher) to quantify the associative distance between responses on divergent thinking (DT) tasks. The authors aimed to determine whether the distance between a DT task stimulus and the generated responses could be reliably assessed and whether these distance indices were related to individual characteristics, such as creative attitudes and values. The results showed that remote and close associations could be reliably measured using these networks, and individuals with more creative attitudes and values tended to produce responses with greater associative distance. The authors suggest that this method could be incorporated into creativity assessments, as it provides an objective way to measure the originality of ideas. \\ Koivisto and Grassini (2023) \\ This study compared the creative performance of humans (n=256) and three AI chatbots (ChatGPT3.5, ChatGPT4, and Copy.Ai) on the Alternative Uses Task (AUT), a measure of divergent thinking. The authors hypothesized that AI chatbots would outperform humans due to their vast memory and ability to access large databases. The results showed that, on average, the AI chatbots did outperform the humans, generating responses that were rated as more creative by human judges. However, the best human responses were still comparable to or better than the AI responses. The authors conclude that while AI has the potential to enhance creativity, it has not yet surpassed the creative potential of the best human performers. \\ Chong et al. (2021) \\ This study investigated the relationship between oxytocinergic and dopaminergic gene expression and creative thinking. The authors hypothesized that these neurotransmitter systems would be associated with creativity, as previous research has suggested their involvement in cognitive and social behaviors related to creativity. The results showed that oxytocinergic gene expression (CD38 and CD157) was significantly associated with divergent thinking in men, but not in women. Dopaminergic gene expression (DRD2 and COMT) was not significantly associated with creativity in the overall sample, but COMT expression was significantly associated with divergent thinking in women when analyzed separately. The authors conclude that oxytocinergic and dopaminergic gene expression may contribute to creative thinking, but the effects may be sex-dependent. \\ Russ and Dillon (2011) \\ This study examined changes in children's pretend play ability over a 23-year period (1985-2008) using the Affect in Play Scale (APS). The authors aimed to determine whether pretend play abilities were improving, declining, or remaining stable over time, given the documented decrease in unstructured playtime for children. The results showed that imagination and comfort in play increased over time, while there was no significant change in the organization of play or the overall expression of affect. However, when one outlier study was removed, there was a significant decrease in negative affect expression in play. The authors conclude that despite the decrease in playtime, some aspects of pretend play are still developing in children, but the potential impact of decreased negative affect expression on creative expression warrants further investigation. \\ Wu and Koutstaal (2020) \\ This study investigated the relationship between cognitive flexibility and creativity using a new measure called Self-Guided Transitions (SGTs). SGTs assess how individuals choose to allocate their efforts between two tasks and how often they switch between them. The authors hypothesized that SGTs would be positively associated with creative performance. The results showed that dwell length (the average number of responses generated before switching) on a divergent thinking task was positively correlated with creative performance across several tasks. Shift count (the number of switches between tasks) was positively correlated with within-task performance on a divergent thinking task but not on a convergent thinking task. The authors conclude that SGTs are a promising new measure for understanding the dynamic cognitive processes that support creative thinking. \\ Holt (2013) \\ This study compared the psi performance (extrasensory perception) of artists and non-artists using a free-response experience sampling method. The author hypothesized that artists would demonstrate more psi-hitting than non-artists and that emotional creativity would be correlated with psi performance. The results showed that while artists performed at a level commensurate with previous research, they did not outperform non-artists. Additionally, none of the creativity measures significantly predicted psi performance. The author concludes that artistic involvement alone does not explain the enhanced psi effect found in previous studies and suggests that future research should explore the interaction between task demands, domain involvement, and person variables. \\ Plucker, Qian, and Schmalensee (2014) \\ This study compared seven different scoring methods for real-world divergent thinking (DT) tasks, including objective and subjective techniques. The authors aimed to determine which scoring methods were most effective in controlling for fluency (the number of responses) while assessing originality. The results suggested that a combination of objective and subjective scoring methods may be optimal for originality scoring on contextualized DT tasks. This finding contrasts with previous research on abstract DT tasks, which suggested that the objective percentage scoring technique might be optimal. The authors conclude that the content of DT tasks can influence the effectiveness of different scoring methods. \\ Lin and Shih (2016) \\ This study investigated the effects of two EEG neurofeedback training protocols on open-ended and closed-ended creativity. Participants were trained to either enhance alpha brainwave activity or to both enhance and suppress alpha activity. The results showed that enhancing alpha activity improved open-ended creativity, while training to both enhance and suppress alpha activity improved both open-ended and closed-ended creativity. This suggests that different neurofeedback protocols may be effective for enhancing different types of creativity. \\ Ordu and Yontem (2020) \\ This study developed a self-assessment scale for divergent thinking in adults. The scale, called the Divergent Thinking Self-Assessment Scale (DTSA), consists of 21 items and two factors: rationality and subjectivity. The DTSA was found to have good psychometric properties, including high internal consistency and validity. This scale could be a useful tool for researchers and practitioners interested in assessing divergent thinking abilities. \\ Taylor et al. (2020) \\ This study examined the relationship between ADHD characteristics, academic aptitude, divergent thinking, and academic performance in engineering students. The results showed that ADHD characteristics were positively associated with divergent thinking but negatively associated with academic performance in engineering courses. This suggests that engineering programs may not be adequately supporting students with ADHD, who may have unique creative strengths. \\ Zabelina et al. (2016) \\ This study investigated the genetic basis of creativity by examining the interaction between two dopamine genes, DAT and COMT. The authors found that different combinations of these genes were associated with different types of creativity, as measured by the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking (divergent thinking) and the Creative Achievement Questionnaire (real-world creative achievement). This suggests that creativity is a complex trait influenced by multiple genetic and environmental factors. \\ Agnoli et al. (2022) \\ This study explored the relationship between spontaneous eye blink rate (sEBR), a proxy for dopamine levels, and divergent thinking. The results showed that individuals with moderate sEBR had the highest originality scores on a divergent thinking task. This suggests that an optimal level of dopamine may be beneficial for creative thinking. Additionally, the study found that the relationship between sEBR and originality was mediated by flexibility, suggesting that dopamine may promote originality by enhancing the ability to switch between different conceptual categories. \\ Mukherjee et al. (2021) \\ This study examined the relationship between emotional intelligence, social intelligence, and creativity in early adolescents. The results showed that all three variables were significantly correlated with each other. Additionally, a multiple regression analysis revealed that emotional and social intelligence could significantly predict creativity. These findings suggest that emotional and social skills may play an important role in the development of creativity in adolescents. \\ Warne et al. (2022) \\ This study examined the factor structure of scores from the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (TTCT) and the International Cognitive Ability Resource (ICAR) intelligence test. The authors hypothesized that the TTCT, a measure of divergent thinking, might actually be measuring general intelligence (g). However, the results were inconclusive, as none of the nine pre-registered factor models fit the data well. A post hoc analysis suggested that the TTCT-Figural (TTCT-F) test, in particular, may not measure a coherent construct, raising questions about its validity. The authors recommend against using overall TTCT-F scores and suggest that the test should be confined to research settings until its psychometric properties are improved. \\ Zabelina et al. (2015) \\ This study investigated the relationship between attention and creativity using the P50 ERP component, a measure of sensory gating (the brain's ability to filter out irrelevant stimuli). The authors found that divergent thinking, as measured by the Abbreviated Torrance Test for Adults (ATTA), was associated with increased sensory gating (i.e., less "leaky" attention), while real-world creative achievement was associated with decreased sensory gating (i.e., more leaky attention). This suggests that different types of attention may be involved in different aspects of creativity. \\ Tran et al. (2020) \\ This study examined whether creativity could be improved through instruction and practice in a 14-week undergraduate creative methods course. The results showed that students' originality on a real-world design challenge significantly increased from pre- to post-test, as did their originality on two verbal Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (TTCT) subtests. However, originality scores on two figural TTCT subtests declined. These findings suggest that creative abilities can be improved through training, but the effects may vary depending on the type of task. \\ Dumas and Strickland (2018) \\ This study examined unsolicited malevolent responses on the Alternate Uses Task (AUT), a measure of divergent thinking. The results showed that male participants generated significantly more malevolent responses than female participants, and that originality (but not fluency) was a significant predictor of malevolence. This suggests that malevolent creativity may be a distinct construct from general divergent thinking ability. \\ Krumm et al. (2020) \\ This study investigated the relationship between executive functions (EFs) and creativity in children. The results showed that children with higher creativity scores on both the TTCT-Figural and CREA-C (a verbal creativity test) had better working memory, inhibition, and spontaneous cognitive flexibility. However, there were no significant differences in reactive cognitive flexibility or planning. These findings suggest that certain EFs may play a role in creative thinking in children. \\ Vessey and Mumford (2012) \\ This article reviews the literature on heuristics (strategies) as a basis for assessing creative potential. The authors discuss various methods for appraising both process-specific heuristics (e.g., those related to problem definition or idea generation) and cross-process heuristics (e.g., those related to variability or forecasting). They also discuss the contingencies that must be considered when using heuristic assessments, such as domain characteristics, expertise, ability, and motivation. The authors conclude that heuristic assessment can be a valuable tool for understanding and enhancing creativity. \\ Skalicky et al. (2017) \\ This study examined the relationship between linguistic features of language produced during collaborative problem-solving tasks and human ratings of creativity. The results showed that linguistic features related to lexical sophistication, cohesion, and rhetorical devices could account for a significant amount of variance in creativity ratings. This suggests that linguistic analysis can be a useful tool for identifying and understanding creative language use. \\ Ka et al. (2023) \\ This study investigated the effects of creativity stimulation on brain connectivity during divergent thinking tasks. The results showed that participants who received creativity stimulation had higher fluency and flexibility scores on the Alternative Uses Task (AUT) compared to controls. Additionally, there were differences in effective connectivity between brain regions associated with divergent thinking between the two groups. These findings suggest that creativity stimulation may enhance divergent thinking abilities and alter brain connectivity patterns. \\ Ahsan et al. (2020) \\ This study examined the relationship between neural sensory gating (indexed by the P50 ERP component) and creative performance on convergent and divergent thinking tasks. The results showed that leaky attention (reduced sensory gating) was positively associated with fluency in divergent thinking but negatively associated with performance on a convergent thinking task. This suggests that the relationship between attention and creative performance may depend on the type of task. \\ Goulet-Pelletier et al. (2022) \\ This study investigated the relationship between perfectionism, excellencism (striving for high but attainable standards), and creative thinking. The results showed that excellencism was positively associated with divergent thinking, associative thinking, and openness to experience, while perfectionism was negatively associated with these variables. This suggests that striving for excellence may be more beneficial for creativity than striving for perfection. \\ Hatch (2022) \\ This article discusses the importance of teaching critical listening skills in music education. It emphasizes that listening is an essential skill for evaluating musical works and performances, as outlined in the National Core Arts Standards. The author provides a lesson example and outlines considerations for teaching this "invisible skill," including establishing classroom norms, selecting appropriate musical excerpts, and providing opportunities for students to express their understanding through various modalities. The article also emphasizes the importance of fostering divergent thinking and allowing for multiple interpretations in music listening activities. \\ Pinheiro and Cruz (2014) \\ This article explores the dimensionality of creativity by examining the relationships between various creativity measurement instruments. The authors used a meta-analysis variant called retro-analysis and network analysis to map the spatial structure between self-proclaimed creativity variables and other related elements. The results suggest that there is a central dimension of novelty in creativity, surrounded by dimensions of negative affect and social leadership, and high cognitive performance and positive affect. The authors also found that tests of divergent thinking, self-reported biographies, and composite scores are the most appropriate tools to measure creativity itself, while attitude and personality inventories are best for diagnosing different types of creators. \\ Brawer and Amir (2021) \\ This study investigated the neuroanatomical correlates of humor creativity in professional comedians. The authors compared the brain anatomy of professional comedians, amateur comedians, and non-comedians using MRI scans. They found that professional comedians had greater cortical surface area in specific brain regions, including the left inferior temporal gyrus, angular gyrus, precuneus, and right medial prefrontal cortex. These regions have been previously implicated in abstract, divergent thinking and the default mode network, which is associated with spontaneous and creative thinking. The findings suggest that these regions may be specifically involved in humor creativity. \\ Kandemir et al. (2019) \\ This study aimed to develop and validate a scale to measure the extent to which mathematics teachers create learning environments that promote student creativity. The authors proposed a framework based on Sternberg's Investment Theory of Creativity and Cropley's framework, suggesting six conditions that mathematics teachers should create to foster creativity: teaching style, innovative teaching practices, asking questions, overcoming barriers, classroom climate, and confidence. The study involved two groups of mathematics teachers, and the results supported the construct validity of the developed scale. The findings suggest that the scale can be used to measure different dimensions of creativity-fostering behaviors of mathematics teachers. \\ Tan and Zou (2015) \\ This study investigated the role of mind wandering in insight problem-solving. The authors used the number reduction task (NRT) and a sustained attention response task (SART) with thought probes to measure mind wandering during an incubation period. The results showed that participants who gained insights into the hidden rule of the NRT reported significantly more mind wandering during incubation than those who did not. Additionally, solvers rated themselves higher in overall creativity. The study suggests that mind wandering may play an important role in solving insight problems. \\ Yamaoka and Yukawa (2020) \\ This study examined the relationships between mind wandering, divergent thinking, and mental health. The authors surveyed 865 college students and found that individuals who reported more depressive symptoms, schizotypal personality, and divergent thinking were more likely to engage in mind wandering. The results suggest that mind wandering is linked to both a risk of poorer mental health and higher divergent thinking ability. The authors call for further research to examine the specific features of mind wandering related to divergent thinking and mental health. \\ Form and Kaernbach (2018) \\ This study investigated the relationship between empathy and different magnitudes of creativity, namely creative achievement (Big C Creativity) and everyday creative activity (little c creativity). The authors hypothesized that empathy would be positively associated with creative achievement but have an inverted-U relationship with everyday creative activity. The results supported these hypotheses, suggesting that more connectedness is not always better for creativity and that the relevance of social aspects for creativity may depend on the magnitude of creativity considered. \\ Lin and Cho (2011) \\ This study investigated the factors that predict creative problem-solving ability in math among Taiwanese elementary school students. The authors developed a new assessment tool, the Creative Problem Solving Attributes Inventory (CPSAI), to measure five key attributes: divergent thinking, convergent thinking, motivation, knowledge and skills, and environment. The results showed that divergent thinking and domain-specific knowledge and skills were the strongest predictors of math problem-solving ability. The study also found that parental influence and motivation played a role in developing children's knowledge and skills, which in turn influenced their math problem-solving ability. \\ Kondratavičienė and Sičiūnienė (2021) \\ This study focused on defining and assessing creative thinking skills in fourth-grade Lithuanian students learning mathematics. The authors developed a test to measure two groups of creative thinking skills: exploration and idea generation, and formulating questions and finding solutions. The test was administered to 404 students, and the results showed no significant gender differences in creative thinking skills. However, students performed better in the exploration and idea generation group compared to the formulating questions and finding solutions group. The study highlights the importance of developing and measuring creative thinking skills in math education. \\ Goldenberg and Wiley (2011) \\ This article reviews the literature on group brainstorming, a technique for generating creative ideas in groups. The authors question some of the assumptions of the traditional brainstorming approach, particularly the emphasis on quantity over quality and the rule of withholding criticism. They discuss the potential benefits of cognitive stimulation and conflict in group brainstorming, and suggest that incorporating measures of idea quality can provide valuable insights into group performance. The article also highlights the importance of considering the broader context of innovation and the role of individual differences in creative problem-solving. \\ Ocampo-González et al. (2019) \\ This study investigated the effects of an 8-week intervention using modified games on the creative abilities of 30 children aged 8-10. The intervention group showed a significant increase in general creativity, particularly in narrative creativity (fluency, flexibility, originality), compared to the control group. The authors suggest that games, as preferred activities, can be effective tools for fostering creativity in children when implemented within a mediated context that emphasizes social interaction and emotional engagement. \\ Leikin et al. (2020) \\ This study explored the relationship between bilingualism, executive functions, and creativity in problem-solving among male university students. The findings showed that balanced bilinguals (Russian/Hebrew) outperformed non-balanced bilinguals (Hebrew/English) on the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (TTCT), particularly in flexibility and fluency, and on the Remote Associates Test (RAT) in English. The study suggests that balanced bilingualism may positively influence divergent thinking and that a well-organized language system, where languages are interconnected, may be a significant factor in creative performance. \\ Cousijn et al. (2014) \\ This study examined the relationship between gray matter morphology (cortical thickness and volume) and divergent thinking in adolescents and young adults. The results showed no significant association between gray matter morphology and verbal divergent thinking. However, visuo-spatial divergent thinking was positively associated with cortical thickness in several brain regions, including the right middle temporal gyrus and left superior frontal gyrus. The study suggests that a widespread brain network involved in flexible visual processing of spatial relationships plays a role in visuo-spatial divergent thinking. \\ Beaty et al. (2014) \\ This study investigated the relative contributions of associative and executive processes in divergent thinking. The authors used latent semantic analysis (LSA) to assess associative abilities and found that semantic distance (a measure of associative ability) and executive functions (broad retrieval ability and fluid intelligence) both predicted divergent thinking. This suggests that both associative and executive processes are important for creative cognition. \\ Hass (2016) \\ This study explored the dynamics of divergent thinking using latent semantic analysis (LSA) to examine changes in semantic distance between responses and the prompt concept across successive response iterations. The results showed a linear increase in semantic distance across response iterations, with individuals high in fluid intelligence tending to give more distant initial responses. Semantic distance also predicted the average creativity rating of responses. The study suggests that LSA can be a useful tool for understanding the cognitive processes involved in divergent thinking. \\ Forthmann et al. (2017) \\ This study examined the influence of typing speed on divergent thinking (DT) performance in online assessments. The results showed that typing speed had mixed effects on fluency, with stronger direct effects observed when participants were instructed to generate many ideas. Additionally, typing speed indirectly influenced the overall quality and cleverness of ideas through cognitive complexity and fluency. The study highlights the importance of controlling for typing speed in online DT assessments and suggests that different quality scores (originality, cleverness, uncommonness, remoteness) may be differentially affected by typing speed. \\ Kudrowitz and Dippo (2013) \\ This study explored the progression of originality in the Alternative Uses Test (AUT). Participants were asked to list alternative uses for a paperclip, and the results showed that later responses were significantly more original than earlier ones. The authors suggest that the first ideas generated are likely to be common and unoriginal, and that pushing past these initial ideas can lead to more creative solutions. The study also provides insights into the relationship between quantity, flexibility, elaboration, and originality in divergent thinking. \\ Jung et al. (2010) \\ This study investigated the relationship between white matter integrity, creativity (divergent thinking and openness to experience), and psychopathology. The results showed that lower white matter integrity in the inferior frontal lobes was associated with higher divergent thinking and openness scores. These findings suggest an overlap in specific white matter architecture underlying the normal variance of divergent thinking, openness, and psychotic-spectrum traits, supporting the idea of a continuum between creativity and psychopathology. \\ Sourcesexpand_more \\ share \\ more_vert \\ Upload an image \\ This prompt requires you to add an image.

My hypothesis is that very divergent thinkers are the key to leaping into the future even faster. I understand that a lot of pushing the envelope innovation might well come from those on the schizophrenia spectrum, like schizotypal people. Can you help me tease out the relevant portions of each of these articles so that i can put the sections in my literature review? \\ Based on the provided articles, here are the relevant portions that discuss the nature of creativity, divergent thinking, and the role of schizotypy or schizophrenia spectrum traits in innovation: \\ From "A Computational Interrogation of 'Big-C' and 'Little-c' Creativity": \\ •	The article questions the "Big-C" and "little-c" hierarchy of creativity, which distinguishes between eminent creators and everyday creators. The computational models show that only about half of disruptive creative changes can be explained by individual factors, suggesting labels like "Big-C" can be misattributed and conflate generative and evaluative dimensions of creativity. \\ From "A Contribution to Scientific Creativity: A Validation Study Measuring Divergent Problem Solving Ability": \\ •	Divergent thinking abilities are considered the most widely used measures for assessing creativity and indicating the potential for creative thought. The study developed a novel divergent problem solving ability in science test (DPAS) to assess students' potential to design different possible solutions for scientific problems, as an outcome measure in intervention studies. \\ •	Creativity together with other science-related activities, such as generating and testing hypotheses, problem finding, and problem solving are highlighted as key aspects of scientific creativity. Several cognitive creativity skills, such as divergent and convergent thinking are considered important. \\ From "Assessment of Intelligence with Creativity - the Need for a Comprehensive Approach": \\ •	The study found creativity to be an independent factor from intelligence. A creativity factor (Cr), composed of fluency, flexibility, originality, and elaboration (verbal and figural), was found to be related to but distinct from fluid intelligence (Gf) and crystallized intelligence (Gc) factors. \\ •	The results call attention to the need to integrate creativity measures with intelligence tests to enable a more comprehensive understanding of cognitive potential. Creativity was not included in intelligence measures as the different dimensions of divergent thinking are not measured by them. \\ From "Automated Creativity Prediction Using Natural Language Processing and Resting-State Functional Connectivity": \\ •	The study found that dynamic connectivity patterns between the default mode network (DMN) and frontoparietal control network (FPCN) during rest robustly predicted divergent thinking performance, even more strongly than static connectivity. This suggests creativity depends on the ordered dynamic recruitment of networks associated with executive and generative processes. \\ •	Creativity seems to depend on the dynamic switching between different thinking processes. The nature of creative thinking can be better represented by its dynamic neural features. \\ In summary, these articles highlight the importance of divergent thinking in creativity that is related to but distinct from intelligence. Dynamic interactions between brain networks seem key to the creative process. However, none of the articles directly discuss schizotypy or the schizophrenia spectrum in relation to creativity and innovation. More targeted searches would be needed to find literature supporting that part of your hypothesis. The articles do provide useful context on the broader nature and neural basis of creativity and divergent thinking. \\ Copy \\ Can Concept Mapping Facilitate Verbal Divergent Thinking \\ PDF \\ CONCEP~1 \\ PDF \\ Creative Factors and Psychotherapeutic Insight Effects of Novelty and Appropriateness. \\ PDF \\ Creative Potential is Differentially Expressed in School, at Home, and the Natural Environment. \\ PDF \\ Defining Creativity - How Far Have We Come Since Plucker, Beghetto, and Dow \\ PDF \\ DR \\ Perfect. What about these? \\ Here are the key points addressing your overall hypothesis that very divergent thinkers, and potentially those on the schizophrenia spectrum, are key to breakthrough creativity and innovation: \\ From "A Computational Interrogation of 'Big-C' and 'Little-c' Creativity": \\ •	The article questions the "Big-C" and "little-c" hierarchy that distinguishes eminent creators from everyday creators.

Higher insightfulness was induced by high novelty and high appropriateness. \\ •	Individuals with anxiety symptoms differed from normal individuals in producing insightfulness, with the low-anxiety group generating higher insightfulness compared to the high-anxiety group, especially when appropriateness was low. \\ From the articles reviewed, there was no direct discussion of schizotypy or the schizophrenia spectrum in relation to breakthrough creativity and innovation. The articles do provide relevant information on: \\ 1.	Questioning a simple dichotomy between eminent and everyday creators \\ 2.	The importance of assessing creativity independently from intelligence \\ 3.	The separate roles of novelty and appropriateness in insightfulness \\ 4.	Differences between anxious and non-anxious individuals in generating insightfulness \\ However, targeted searches would be needed to find literature directly supporting the link between highly divergent thinking, schizotypy, and innovative breakthroughs. The current articles provide useful background but do not appear to directly address that specific hypothesis. Additional research in that particular area seems warranted to bolster the literature review. \\  \\  \\ DR \\ I'm researching the nature of creativity and its essence, how to pull it out and empower it within organizations. My hypothesis is that very divergent thinkers are the key to leaping into the future even faster. I understand that a lot of pushing the envelope innovation might well come from those on the schizophrenia spectrum, like schizotypal people. Can you help me tease out the relevant portions of each of these articles so that i can put the sections in my literature review? \\ Based on the provided research articles, here are some key points that could be relevant for your literature review on creativity and the role of divergent thinkers in driving innovation: \\ From the article "Digital Games for Creativity Assessment: Strengths, Weaknesses and Opportunities": \\ •	Existing creativity assessments often rely on unnatural testing environments, capture only coarse-grained snippets of the creative process, and require subjective, resource-intensive human evaluation. Digital games have potential to address these limitations by providing more engaging environments, capturing finer-grained creative process data, and enabling scalable algorithmic evaluation. However, more research is needed to validate game-based creativity assessments. \\ From "Divergent Thinking: The Role of Decision-Making Styles": \\ •	Results showed that rational decision-making style predicted both verbal and visual divergent thinking performance. This confirms the key role of rationality, in addition to intuition, in the creative process. The authors propose that rationality allows following logical steps that support creativity. \\ From "Does Episodic Retrieval Contribute to Creative Writing? An Exploratory Study": \\ •	The study found preliminary evidence that episodic memory retrieval contributes to generating event and scene details during creative writing. Episodic retrieval boosts inclusion of internal/episodic details in stories, without impacting external/semantic details. This suggests episodic memory enables mentally constructing and describing vivid scenes in creative writing. \\ From "Domain-specific and Domain-general Creativity Differences between Expert and Novice Designers": \\ •	Design students (experts) exhibited better domain-general creativity (verbal and visual divergent thinking) compared to non-design students (novices). Design training enhanced domain-specific design creativity through both an "originality" pathway focused on novelty and an "amenity" pathway focused on likability/beauty. Visual divergent thinking mediated the effect of design expertise on design task performance. This supports both domain-general and domain-specific aspects of creativity. \\ In summary, these articles provide evidence for the roles of divergent thinking, episodic memory retrieval, decision-making style, and domain expertise in various facets of creativity. Digital games and analysis of creative writing are discussed as promising approaches to study the creative process. The findings could inform your hypothesis that highly divergent thinkers, potentially including schizotypal individuals, are crucial for boundary-pushing innovation. The articles establish divergent thinking as a key component of creativity that can be enhanced through rational decision-making and domain-specific training. Further research using the methodologies discussed, with a focus on highly divergent thinkers, may help elucidate their role in organizational innovation. \\ Copy \\ Editorial Introduction to the Special Issue “Advances in the Measurement and Evaluation of Creativity \\ PDF \\ Effective Strategies for Creative Idea Evaluation and Feedback - The customer’s always right \\ PDF \\ Empathizing with the End User - Effect of Empathy and Emotional Intelligence on Ideation. \\ PDF \\ Employees’ Attitudes and Values toward Creativity, Work Environment, and Job \\ PDF \\ Emulating Coworkers - How and When Coworker Ideation Facilitates Employee Ideation. \\ PDF \\ DR \\ Sweet! How about these? \\ Based on the provided research articles, here are the most relevant points that could support your hypothesis about divergent thinkers and schizotypal individuals being key to driving innovation: \\ From the editorial introduction article: \\ 1.	Research has moved away from trying to find a simple "g factor" of creativity and a single measure to assess it. Instead, the field has embraced the complexity, multidimensional, dynamic and sociocultural nature of creativity. This broader perspective allows focusing on specific aspects like divergent thinking. \\ 2.	There is a trend of examining the validity of creativity measurements. This is important to ensure divergent thinking measures are psychometrically robust. \\ 3.	Another trend is quantifying creativity within a broader system of measures rather than in isolation. This holistic approach could help understand how divergent thinking relates to other individual differences. \\ From the article on divergent thinking and decision-making styles: \\ 4.	Results showed rational decision-making style predicted both verbal and visual divergent thinking performance. However, the hypothesized relationship between intuitive style and divergent thinking was not supported. This suggests rationality, not just intuition, plays a key role in divergent thinking. \\ 5.	Emotional intelligence was related to better detection of problems and generation of more ideas on divergent thinking tasks. This ability to identify and leverage emotions may be another important factor beyond just highly divergent thought. \\ From the article on emulating coworkers: \\ 6.	Creative coworkers can serve as role models that employees emulate, increasing the employees' own creative self-efficacy and ideation. Having highly creative colleagues may be one way organizations can foster more divergent thinking. \\ 7.	The influence of creative coworkers on an employee's own creativity is stronger when they have a high-quality exchange relationship. So the social dynamics around divergent thinkers also matter. \\ In summary, these findings emphasize the value of divergent thinking ability but also highlight the importance of considering it within a broader context of individual differences, decision-making approaches, interpersonal dynamics, and robust measurement practices when examining its role in driving innovation. The articles did not focus on schizotypy specifically, but investigating divergent thinking in those populations using some of the frameworks discussed here could yield important insights. Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on any of these points! \\
